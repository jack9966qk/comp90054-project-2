## Approaches

### Reinforcement Learning

feature extraction...

reward...

algorithm (Q-learning)...

### Reinforcement Learning with Modes

modes: offense, defense, backhome

train weights for each mode separately

### Predefined Weights with Modes

using predefined weights instead of trained weights...

### MCTS

UCB1

stop early instead using feature * weights (?)

### Others

Deep Q-learning (CNN with matrix input or dense layers with features as input, learning actions or modes), value approximation etc.

Pure reinforcement learning does not produce good results, because...

The agent performs better with mode selection because...

Learning weights for each mode is more effective because...
